# Apple-iBooks-Highlighted-Text-Parser üìù ![StatusBadge](https://badgen.net/badge/Status/Completed/green) 

### This Python script exports all **notes** from the *iBooks database* and creates a *txt file* for each book.

The script **also handles the annotation colors, they will be annotated apart from the actual annotation**.

It's possible to *annotate a single annotation* in three different ways **in order to let the script interpret that annotation as a chapter title**.

You can use:
- *".h1" to mark as **HEADING 1** (Larger)*
- *".h2" to mark as **HEADING 2** (Medium)*
- *".h3" to mark as **HEADING 3** (Smallest)*

___

## **FEATURES:**
- Automatically extract every single important information of every note and book from iBooks Databases.
- Automatic formatting of the content of each note to ensure full compatibility with the txt file.
- Creation of individual txt files containing the annotations of each book.
- Inserting annotation colors.
- Inserting chapter titles.
- Split txt file with chapter titles.
